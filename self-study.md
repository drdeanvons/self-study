# Self Study Onboarding Material

## Preamble

This onboarding material is designed to provide you with a wide range of resources to build a foundational understanding of key web development concepts. While you do not need to cover all of the material, it is recommended that you gain a basic understanding of these topics. The resources listed are optional, and you are encouraged to explore them at your own pace.

Your goal should be to acquire fundamental knowledge and skills in areas like the Internet, HTML, CSS, and Git, which will help you work effectively on projects. By the end of your self study, you should feel comfortable with the essential concepts and be able to apply the fundamentals.

### Learning Goals

By the end of this self-study, you should be able to:

1. **Explain** how the Internet works, including HTTP, DNS, and hosting.
2. **Describe** the basic structure and purpose of HTML and CSS in web development.
3. **Create** simple web pages using semantic HTML and basic CSS layouts.
4. **Use** Git for version control to manage and track changes in a basic project or simple text files.
5. **Explain** how browsers render web pages and how web performance impacts user experience.
6. **Identify** some best practices for web accessibility and basic SEO principles.
7. **Understand** how to make simple web pages responsive using CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid.

You will further develop and use these skills throughout the course. This is just a starting point as we don't cover these explicitly. We will cover these topics indirectly, but we will focus on more critical and comprehensive skills.
